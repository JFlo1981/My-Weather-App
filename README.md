### This project was built from the ground up.  No files were provided to build from.

My job on this project is to create a website which will provide the user with a search bar to make a search for weather by location.  The user input is to be used for an API fetch which will provide the necessary information to build the page.  The user will be presented with the current conditions for the chosen city as well as a 5-day forecast.  
A header bar will contain the search bar as well as the current time and date of the user's current location.
The current weather will display the city name, the temperature, the humidity, wind direction and speed.  A UV section will provide the current conditions represented by a weather icon and the current UV Index.  This tile will also change colors to represent the current UVI level.
The 5-day forecast section is to feature 5 tiles to contain the weather for the next 5 days.  It will include the date, a weather icon, high and low temperature, the wind direction and speed and the humidity.
There will also be a search history section which will hold the most recent user searches.  If clicked, the user will be presented with the current and future weather for that city.
